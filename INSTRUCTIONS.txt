Instructions to setup machine:
- open a terminal
- cd to directory where the file init.sh (in this folder) lives
- run the following command:
	./init.sh


* In general, in each step of the script, just type 'y' to accept
and continue.


The script will now walk you through the following steps:

- Step 1: Setup bash_profile
	- ** Note: this will overwrite your existing bash_profile

- Step 2: Install homebrew and required packages
	- You may get a pop up asking to install XCode, accept this and
		go through the installation process

- Step 3: Download marketlive files

- Step 4: Setup mongo

- Step 5: Set a new master password
	- This is for maven and can be anything you want

- Step 6: Set a new nexus username/password
	- This step is to gain access to the maven repositories
	- The user/pass combo is the same user and pass used
		to log into the VPN through tunnelblick
	- It will look something similar to:
		Username: ml.amohades
		Password: Yaiq22r!

- Step 7: Setup SSH key:
	- During development, you will need to ssh into virtualbox frequently
	- This command is run once manually so that the SSH key can be added to the list
		of permanently known hosts
	- When prompted if you want to add the host, type 'p' to add it permanently
	- IMPORTANT: If virtualbox is not installed and running, this step will timeout
		and fail. You can always come back and do this step later after setting up
		virtualbox.


After all of these steps complete without errors, your machine is ready


** Note: if you need to run any step of the script again, you can just
run ./init.sh again and skip the steps you already completed by typing
'n' for no.
